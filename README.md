# DataByDesign

*Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization, 1786-1900* challenges the commonly-held belief that visualization serves as a neutral method for data’s display. In a series of five “data narratives” — chapter-length web-based texts that employ interactive visualizations in order to advance their claims — this project traces the rise of modern data visualization techniques.

While we are designing and prototyping the project site, you can visit [lklein.com/data-by-design/](lklein.com/data-by-design/) to read a bit more about the project’s intellectual underpinnings. You can also explore our investigations of [Elizabeth Palmer Peabody’s chronological grids](http://shapeofhistory.net/) and [William Playfair’s time-series charts](http://dhlab.lmc.gatech.edu/repairing-william-playfair/). We are currently adapting both of those projects into data narratives for *Data by Design*.
